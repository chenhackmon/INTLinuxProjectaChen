Kernel System Calls
-------------------
I downloaded the project and connected it to git.
Next i checked the processor compatibility using the command uname -m.
After verifying the processor i downloaded a file from the appropriate link:
wget https://alonitac.github.io/devopsthehardeay/linux_project/amd64.whatido
After downloading the file i granted permission to it using the command
sudo chmod 777 whatIdo
following the permissions i executed the file using
strace ./whatIdo
it showed me what the program did from what i observed it created a new directory named 'welcometodevopsthehardway'
after that i changed directory to the new folder and then used 'ls' which displayed goodluck


Broken Symlink
-------------------

The issue arises when the symbolic link latest-backup.obj is moved into the backups directory.
When the symbolic link is moved, it doesn't retain its original functionality of
pointing to the last generated backup file outside of the backups directory.
Instead, it ends up pointing to a non-existent file path relative to its new location within backups.
To fix this issue and ensure that latest-backup.obj always points to the correct latest backup file,
 regardless of where it is accessed from, we should create the symbolic link with an absolute path.

Binary Numbers
--------------
A.
111 --> 7
100 --> 4
10110 --> 22
b.
0 - 255 --> 256  number
The available decimal range represented by an 8 bit binary number is from 0  to 255
c.
To represent numbers from -255 to 255 with a 9-bit binary number using Twos complement:
use the MSB to indicate sign:
0 for non-negative numbers 0-255
1 for negative number -1 to -255
d.
To represent floating-point numbers using 8 bits:
Use 4 bits for the integer part and 4 bits for the fractional part
